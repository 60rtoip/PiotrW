-- about the program --

This is a program that I myself will be using from now on, and will be upgrading it in the future for sure. It has some quality features that i really needed, and could not find a good program with all of them. It has 4 features for now:


-VolumeMixer
    It was very tidious for me to go to Windows VolumeMixer every time there was a too Loud 
    program running.
    
-AppLauncher
    I really do not like the Windows File system, it just doesnt look very well, and i hate to have
    my desktop full with apps, i prefer there to be as little as possible.
    
-MusicPlayer
    This music player has a feature to run music in random order, and while there are programs 
    that do that, this one does not require internet to run, and with that, i have everything in
    one place.
    
-Saper
    This is particularly close to my heart, because i can not count how many times have i wanted
    to play saper on my computer when internet was gone. I often play saper on browser, but now i will not need to ever again.


It is still in early stages, i will probably be making a lot of adjustments to it. It was
a really hard project for me, because of how Windows makes it hard, and the fact that it is 
basically my first time in a serious project in python didnt make it better. The optimalization 
was very bad all the time. I have asked many people and AI to help optimize it, because at times
it just didnt want to run. This expirience made me a lot more proficient with python and made
me realize how hard it is to work with it. The worst part i think was with making the app look
somewhat bearable. I used a clever trick to make the corners round, but that only gave me a lot of
headackes later. But, it works, and i made it as user friendly as possible. I am also proud that it
works in .exe file. With that i can run it in autorun on Windows, and always have it ready when 
needed. I can hide the main window with a small arrow button so that it does not disturb in 
whatever i am doing, and is always on top of any other apps.


And that is my program.

Best regards,

PS:
If it does not work, i will add a picture with screens of a working program. (Zdjecia.png)
The VolumeMixer, AppLauncher and MusicPlayer all always generate in those positions.
